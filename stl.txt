very helpful for competitive programming
library of :generic classes and functions in cpp
save time

components of stl:
i.container(stores data)->uses template calsses
ii.algorithms 
iii.iterator(object that points to an element in the container )
    it connects algoritms and components
    -handled just like pointers

containers:
-sequence containers->linear fashion(vector,list,dequeue)
-associate containers->direct access(map,multimap,dictionary,set,multimap)
-derived containers->real world modelling->stack,queue,priority queue

*sequence containers:
vecotor:
random access:fast
in middle insertion/deletion:slow
insertion at the end:fast

list:
-random access:slow
-middle insertion :fast

associative containers:
-all operations fast 
-except random

Derived containers:
depends -data structures
