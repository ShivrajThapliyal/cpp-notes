Cpp has uses the concept of stream and stream classes to iplement i/o operations
-i/o sstem in cpp is designed to work with a wide ariety of devices includeing treminals ,disks, and tape drives
stream: A stream is a sequence of bytes. It acts etiher as a suurce from which the 
input data can be obtainded or as a destivation to which the output data can be sent.
-The source stram that provides tdata to the progaram is called the input stream and the dessivation stream thagt receives toutput from 
the program is called the output stream.
-basically a stream extracts the bytes from the input stream and inserts bytes on the output stream
-stream acts as an interface between the i/o devices


The classes istream and ostream define  two member fucions get) and put() respectively to handle the single cahracter i/o
we can use : get(char*)  or get(void): to fetch a charactr including blank space, taband the newlive cahracter
get(char *): assigns the inut character 
get(void):returns the input character
char c;
cin.get(c);
or 
c=cin.get();

cout.put(c);

getline(line ,size);
***  cout.write(line, size);


Formatted console I/O operations

1.width()  2.precision()    3.fill()    4.setf()    5.unsetf()

cout.width(int w);
cout<<543;
out:__543
it looses its setting after printing once

2.cout.precesion(d);
cout.precesion(3);
cout<<sqrt(2);
out:1.141
doesn't loose its setting

3.cout.fill('*')
this will fill the remaining fields with *
